# Winblows-Maintenace-Tool
First thing that I unironically made in Batch.
## Latest Version
```
0.1 Rev2
```
## So, what's this for?
It was made by me to do basic maintenace tasks, with no input from the user. A few button presses might be done. 
## Is this an original idea?
Absolutely not. There exists countless of other tools to clean up temporary files and all of that stuff.
## Why?
Because I was bored
## How to download?
clone the repository or use releases if i do make releases (trust me, i probably wont)
## Help make the tool!
Got nice commands you want included? Fork the repo, download the bat file, edit it, and upload it to GitHub and make a Pull Request
