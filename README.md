# Winblows-Maintenace-Tool
First thing that I unironically made in Batch.
## Latest Version

## So, what's this for?
It was made by me to do basic maintenace tasks, with no input from the user. A few button presses might be done. 
## Is this an original idea?
Absolutely not. There exists countless of other tools to clean up temporary files and all of that stuff.
## Why?
Because I was bored
